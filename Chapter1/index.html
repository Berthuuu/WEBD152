    <p> My favorite beverage is tea, specifically Four Season Tea, it's a type </p>
    <p> of green that is floral more than green tea, has less caffeine and isn't bitter compare </p>
    <p> to green tea. It goes well with certain toppings like boba, coconut jelly and maybe </p>
    <p> grass jelly but I prefer having pineapple flavor coconut jelly.</p>
